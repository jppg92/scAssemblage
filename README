"scAssemblage" is the first of a series of custom-made, open-access, machine concepts which looks into machine vision and image processing algorithms used in gyneco-technologies. It is part of a reseacrh project I currently develop at Goldsmiths University London in as part of my master in Computational Arts.
Concpet: "scAssemblage" looks into the potential of 3D scanning using Kinect to turn single scans into unpredictable point cloud "assemblages" later usable as "uncanny" CGI models. Through a transparent interface (e. g., the grayscaling process is visible and controllable), the machine displays some of the step involved in the making of those 3D assemblages. Further, I implemented touchOsc controllers as to make the scanning process remotely easier. The transparency and simplicity of the scanning process are here to inform the user of some, relatively simple, algorithmic decisions undertook to create 3D renderings from physical objects. In simplifying the acquisition steps, the machine allows us to see how engineers engineered the ways they make our world viewable. Further, in including a random function in the code, I tried making the machine participation more explicit. Indeed, this random function merges all the 3D meshes of the uterus into one accumulated 3D mesh. The randomization allocates each mesh on a random x, y, z axis, creating unique assemblages facilitated by the machine decision and the user co-dependency upon his companion. 
As described in its code, its a work in progress. I puted it on gitHub in order to get advices on its further developpment. Any suggestions is more than welcome!

!! I am very new to coding in openframeworks !!
